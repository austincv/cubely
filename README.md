# cubely
A shot at detecting and reading a rubik's cube using opencv and python

We intend to do the 3x3 first and then move to other sizes of cubes. The code is written against opencv 3.0.0. It is in python right now for ease of prototyping. We might decide to do more efficient implementations once we have got the core of our logic correct.

Help articles for installation and running opencv from the ground up will be provided as the project matures.
